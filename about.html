		<h2>About WTG</h2>
			<div class="about-text"><p>WTG — What The... Global. Single-voice technology commentary. No sponsors. No advisory board. No content calendar. Just observations about technology, power, and the structures that connect them.</p>

<p>This reads like a Substack. It functions like a signal flare.</p>

<p>The premise is simple: every technology has a beneficiary. If you cannot name the beneficiary, you are probably the product. If the beneficiary is obvious but no one is saying it out loud, that silence is the story.</p>

<p>WTG covers the technology industry the way an intelligence analyst would cover a foreign government: who benefits, who is harmed, what is the stated purpose versus the actual function, and where are the collection mechanisms disguised as features.</p>

<p>Topics include but are not limited to: AI companies that are actually surveillance companies. Voice assistants that are actually biometric collection platforms. Social media algorithms that are actually talent identification funnels. Fiction as intelligence. Content pipelines that perform intelligence functions at scale. The Department of War rename. Semantic naming as institutional intent. The algorithm sorts.</p>

<p>Part of the EGEX Network. Adjacent to <a href="https://anduril.wtf">ANDURIL.WTF</a> (defense tech) and <a href="https://globaltech.ngo">Global Tech</a> (policy). The .wtf is shared. The editorial position is shared. The filter is not.</p></div>
